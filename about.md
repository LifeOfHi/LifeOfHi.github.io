<h1>About me</h1>

My name is Hari Ilangovan, and I am currently a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Master's of Science in Analytics program. I have a passion for data science and I'm developing skills in the areas of Operations Research, Statistics, and Computing.

Prior to graduate school, I spent a few years as a Data Analytics Consultant in the Financial Services industry. I worked on analytics and audit projects with a focus on Anti Money Laundering. I'm originally from the New England area and I graduated from Northeastern University in Boston, MA with a BS in Chemical Engineering.
