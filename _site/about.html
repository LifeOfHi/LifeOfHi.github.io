			<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Hari Ilangovan, and I am currently a full-time graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Master’s of Science in Analytics program. The Analytical Tools track I’m pursuing focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of critical data science topics and applying this knowledge through programming. My coursework focuses on key concepts in Operations Research, Statistics, and Computing.</p>

<p>Prior to graduate school, I spent a few years as a Data Analytics consultant in the Financial Services industry. I worked on analytics and audit projects with a focus on Anti Money Laundering. I’m originally from the New Englang area and I graduated from Northeastern University in Boston, MA with a BS in Chemical Engineering.</p>
